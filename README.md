# Cynate Movies

This project is a simple React application that showcases movies using the TMDB API. It is built with Vite for a modern development experience and includes Firebase for authentication, React Router DOM for routing, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Key Features:

- **Firebase Authentication:** Secure user authentication to manage user sessions.
- **React Router DOM:** Dynamic routing for a seamless navigation experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern design.
- **TMDB API:** Integration with The Movie Database (TMDB) API for fetching movie data.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
