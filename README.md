# Cynate Movies

Cynate Movies is a simple React application that showcases movies using the TMDB API. It is built with Vite for a modern development experience and incorporates Firebase for authentication, React Router DOM for routing, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Key Features

- **Firebase Authentication:** Secure user authentication to manage user sessions.
- **React Router DOM:** Dynamic routing for a seamless navigation experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern design.
- **TMDB API Integration:** Fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules for better code quality.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/#vitejs-plugin-react)
